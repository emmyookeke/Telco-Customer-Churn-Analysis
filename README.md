#Overview
This project involves analyzing customer churn data from a telecommunications company using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.

# Project Structure
The project is structured into the following main sections:

Data Collection
Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Model Building and Evaluation
Conclusion and Recommendations
# 1. Data Collection
# Description
The dataset used in this project contains customer data from a telecommunications company, including demographic details, account information, service usage patterns, and whether the customer has churned.

# 2. Data Preprocessing
# Tasks
Loading Data: Import the dataset into Excel.
Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values appropriately using Excel functions.
Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates and correct any inconsistencies in the data.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using Excel functions.
Scaling Features: Normalize or standardize numerical features for better analysis.

# Instructions
Open the Excel workbook.
Use functions like IFERROR, IF, ISBLANK, TRIM, and CLEAN to handle missing values and clean data.
Apply VLOOKUP or INDEX-MATCH for encoding categorical variables.
Use MIN, MAX, and STDEV functions for feature scaling.

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Objectives
Understand the distribution of the data.
Identify relationships between features and the target variable (churn).
Visualize key trends and patterns.

# Visualizations
Histograms: For numerical features.
Bar Charts: For categorical features.
Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts: To explore relationships between features.
Correlation Matrix: Using conditional formatting to highlight correlations.

# Instructions
Use INSERT -> PivotTable to create pivot tables.
Create charts using INSERT -> Chart options.
Apply conditional formatting to visualize correlations in a correlation matrix.

# Tools
Excel Data Analysis Toolpak
Solver Add-in
